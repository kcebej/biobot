**NB:** There are also TODO comments in the code, this is the big stuff.

- Stacked area chart of county-level data by state. What stopped me here is that the data is a little annoying to munge since the timeseries for each county has a different number of elements because they don't all start on the same date.

- Hover tooltips to expose detail - what is the value on X date?

- Obviously there's a ton more you could do with the data. Sticking with state data, a comparison view of two or more states. Then you'd also need a chart legend.
